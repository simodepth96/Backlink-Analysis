# Backlink Semantic Analysis

This project enhances your backlink profile analysis by combining **Domain Rating (DR)** with **semantic relevance** between backlinks and your website‚Äôs target pages.

## The Process

1. **Export your backlinks**  
   Go to the **Backlinks** section in [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/), and export the report as a **CSV** file.

2. **Clean the file and convert to XLSX**  
   Open the CSV file and **remove any unnecessary columns manually**. Save the cleaned file as an `.xlsx`.  
   The expected input file must contain the following headers
   
   <img width="1923" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/511a790d-1290-4520-99f0-9643fd360b58" />

4. **Upload your file to the app**  
   Head over to the [Streamlit app](https://semantic-backlink-similarity.streamlit.app/) and upload your `.xlsx` file.

5. **Select a model**  
   Once uploaded, select a model from the dropdown menu.  
   I strongly recommend using **`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** ‚Äî it‚Äôs lightweight, robust, and offers the best balance between semantic performance and resource efficiency
**TL;DR - it's the most accurate and the quickest one to run especially if you have +100K or rows to process**

### The Python Script

The core of this project is a [Python script](https://github.com/simodepth96/Backlink-Analysis/blob/main/raw_code.py) that:

1. **Generates embeddings** for both backlink URLs and target page URLs using one model of your choice from `sentence-transformers`, which is a library well known for semantic understanding.
2. **Computes cosine similarity** between each backlink and its corresponding target page to quantify semantic closeness.
3. **Visualizes the data** with:
   - A **scatterplot** showing Domain Rating (DR) vs. Cosine Similarity
   - A **bar chart** of the **Top 10 backlinks** ranked by semantic similarity
   - A **downloadable dataset** of the full analysis output

### The Streamlit App

A [Streamlit app](https://semantic-backlink-similarity.streamlit.app/) was built upon the script to get you started with ease. 

Simply upload an Ahrefs backlink export in `.xlsx` format and evaluate your brand's backlink profile using **cosine similarity** as a measure of semantic proximity between backlink URLs and their corresponding target URLs.

## What's Cosine Similarity?
Cosine similarity is used as a notion of proximity between the vectors to express a score of similarity between the documents, namely the backlink URLs and the related Target URL. 

## Why Combine DR and Semantic Similarity?

While Domain Rating is a widely used authority signal, it has limitations and can be influenced by outliers depending on how third-party providers (Ahrefs, SEMrush) trained their datasets and how machine learning systems were instructed to retrieve the raw data to build up the metric.

Adding cosine similarity between backlinks and target URLs gives your analysis an additional **semantic layer of precision**.

> ‚úÖ **Ideal backlinks**: High DR + High Cosine Similarity (close to 1)  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential red flags**: Low DR and Low Semantic Similarity

### Cosine Similarity is the scrapped copy of Google's RankEmbed

A word or two of caution with the cosine similarity as we know it.
Cosine similarity only compares the angle of word vectors, but doesn't factor in  their magnitude (length). Hence, it sacrifices meaning by ignoring true word relationships and order, so just the semantic match. In fact, it doesn‚Äôt capture word order or true relationships‚Äîso phrases like ‚Äúthe dog chased the cat‚Äù and ‚Äúthe cat chased the dog‚Äù look the same to it.
Plus, embeddings aren‚Äôt perfect‚Äîthey‚Äôre rough approximations, and CS doesn‚Äôt catch subtle differences in meaning. Use it to guide analysis, not as the final answer

But Google indexing pipelines go further: RankEmbed also considers the vector length other than the angle of the vectors, which lets it mix in extra signals like PageRank, freshness, or click data.

**What does it mean?**
- SEO Indexation - this means that search results aren‚Äôt ranked by meaning alone but are boosted by authority and relevance signals too.
- SEO audit - this means that cosine similarity acts as a leading indicator to support the analysis.
It doesn't reflect how Google prepares their cached index to meet the search query vectors; therefore, **avoid acting upon this indicator alone**.

### Enter the Contextual Authority Score metric

I coined the label to describe a compounded metric designed to quantify the impact and topical relevance of an individual backlink.
It blends page authority, link dilution, and semantic relevance into a single, actionable score ‚Äîhelping SEOs evaluate backlink quality in line with modern ranking signals.

As per the formula

> CAS = (UR / ExLC) √ó S

- UR (URL Rating): A numerical representation of the authority of the linking page, often derived from PageRank-like metrics. Unlike domain-level scores (e.g., Domain Rating or Domain Authority), UR focuses on the strength of a specific URL.

- ExLC (External Link Count): The total number of outbound links (pointing to external domains) from the linking page. It serves as a dilution factor, reducing the perceived value of a backlink when it's one of many on a page.

- S (Cosine Similarity): A semantic similarity score that reflects how contextually or topically relevant the referring page is to the target page.

üìä Interpretation of CAS Values:
- High CAS ‚Üí A link is both authoritative and topically relevant.
- Low CAS ‚Üí A link may come from a weak page, be overly diluted, or be semantically off-topic.

üß∞ Use Cases:
- Backlink Auditing: Identify which links are most beneficial and which are low-quality or off-topic.
- Link Prospecting: Target high CAS opportunities when building new links.
- SEO Reporting: Provide a data-driven score that reflects both authority and relevance.

üìå Important Notes:
CAS should not be used in isolation. It complements other qualitative and technical backlink evaluation factors (e.g., placement, anchor text).
As with other metrics, CAS is largely biased by the default infidelity of the input metrics (e.g., UR is an Ahref's proprietary metric whose tracking criteria are unknown but are surely grounded in their approach to data mining from the organic clickstream).

## How is this Helpful for SEO and Digital PR?

- Uncover **undervalued but contextually strong** backlinks.
- Spot **irrelevant high-DR links** that don‚Äôt support your campaign narrative.
- Prioritise link opportunities that align both **authority** and **semantic context**.
