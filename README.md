# Backlink-Analysis

The purpose of this script is to move beyond Domain Rating and assess link quality based on semantic relevance. 

Backlink URLs are seized against their target destination based on semantic similarity. Cosine similarity is used as a notion of proximity between the vectors to express a score of similarity between the documents, namely the backlink URLs and the related Target URL. 

This effort can help Digital PR teams to surface under-valued links and identify placements that might not support the campaign narrative.
